- Each data is separated by one or more tab characters.

  If you need to include a tab character in data, it must be escaped
  by "\" (back slash). Backslash itself can be denoted by doubling
  it. e.g. "\\" [not impremented yet]

- A message must start with the message type field in a character
  type. e.g. 'B'

- You should ommit the message size field. It must be caliculated by
  the program.

-  You can use an empty line or a line starting with '#' for readbility
   sake.

- If the message type does not have any message data, the line should
  end with a message type field.

- Otherwise, starts with a message type field, a tab, then end with
  the message data.

- For frontend to read a message from backend till "ready for query"
